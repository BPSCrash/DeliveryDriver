# :truck: Devilish Dave - Delivery Driver

Basic DHL training guide - grab box - dropkick it - deliver it! <br />
Not really a full game just some simple pick-up and drop off mechanics while driving a cool car

## :keyboard: How to use

- Arrow keys to drive :car:
- Pick up the red Squares :b:
- Deliver to red Circle :red_circle:
- Boost on the Blue Triangles :arrow_up_small:

## :camera_flash: Caught in (almost) 4K
For this project I learnt how to make a basic 2D movement script and controls and working with triggers and colliders.
